# ece244_labs
Second year ECE course at University of Toronto about Object Oriented Programming Concepts

This repository includes my code and the laboratory instructions (for most labs).  

Much of the laboratory work (labs 2 through 4 and 7 to be more precise) involved building a program that simulates a network of resistors on a breadboard. The user can add and modify resistors at nodes across an infinitely large breadboard. In addition, the user can also specify voltages at every node and ask the program to solve for voltages at every node. 

A short description of each lab is given below:

### lab1

Debug and fix an existing program

### lab2

Build a parser for what would eventually become a program which simulates a breadboard and solves for voltages at every node

### lab3 

Still working on it.

### lab4

Still working on it.

### lab5

Still working on it.

### lab6

Still working on it.

### lab7

Still working on it.

A word of advise for ECE 1T9's and beyond looking at this repository, it's great if you want to look at other people's code to expose yourself to different approaches to problem solving, but don't indulge in cargo cult programming.
